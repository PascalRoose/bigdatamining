# Big Data Mining and Applications, Fall 2019

This course discusses issues in scalable mining of big data in various applications, which is gaining more popularity in recent years.
The major focus in this course will be utilizing parallel progamming in distributed platforms for efficient mining of different kinds of big data.
The course is offered at graduate-level, and will be taught in English.


[*** NOTE ***]: This course is NOT an introductory course for undergraduates. You are required to take the first course of "Introduction to Big Data Analytcis" or "Data Mining" in the undergraduate-level as as prerequisite.
It contains very heavy loads of parallel programming, which is a totally different concept from sequential programming.
Please think twice before taking this course!


Please read the notes to the course very carefully about the requirements for the programming homework and quiz.
